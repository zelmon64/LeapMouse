Leap mouse

=========
Digit configuration is reference in binary with the thumb as 2^0 and the little finger as 2^4. The digit is a one if it is extended and a zero if it is bent.

To activate the mouse: 3 -> 7
To deactivate the mouse: 3 -> 1
The mouse gestures are only valid when the palm is facing down. Facing the palm up with all digits extended will recenter the mouse.
Each digit controls a mouse button when it is the only one bent. From thumb to little finger the buttons are middle, left, right, four and five.
The button is held down when the digit is bent and released once it is extended.
To move the mouse move the hand horizontally and vertically with all digits extended (31) and facing down.

To activate the keyboard: 2 -> 6
To deactivate the keyboard: 19 -> 17
The characters are arranged in rings where the inner ring is just the key, the middle ring is that key plus shift and the outer ring is used for spacebar, backspace and return.
The character will be displayed as they are gestured to and will be applied after the gesture is stopped (all extended). This is done by deleting the previously shown character when the next one is displayed.
The gestures are for A-I (3), J-R (6), S-Z (7), 0-9 (19) and the remaining symbols (18).
